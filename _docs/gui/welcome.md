The Asali version with **Graphical User Interface** is an open-source code developed for engineers, chemists and students working on the modeling of gas phase mixture. From one side, thanks to its user-friendly interface, Asali is very helpful for those approaching the modeling of gas phase mixture for the first time. On the other side, the deep interaction with [Cantera](https://cantera.org/)  allows more expert users in performing detailed simulations without losing time in coding their own models.

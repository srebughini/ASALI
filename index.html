            <p>The Asali version with <b>GUI</b> is an open-source code developed for engineers, 
                chemists and students working on the modeling of gas phase mixture. 
                From one side, thanks to its user-friendly interface, 
                Asali is very helpful for those approaching the modeling of gas phase mixture 
                for the first time. On the other side, the deep interaction with 
                <a href="https://cantera.org/">Cantera</a> allows more expert users in performing detailed simulations without 
                losing time in coding their own models.

            <h3 class="text-center">Application Programming Interface</h3>
            <p>The Asali version with <b>API</b> is an open-source code developed for 
                engineers, chemists and students working on the modeling of gas phase mixture. 
                This version of Asali is very helpful for those who need a reliable, 
                simple and perfoming library for the estimation of thermodynamic and transport 
                properties of ideal gas mixture.
                <br>If you are looking for something more advanced and with higher performance, 
                we suggest <a href="https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/">OpenSMOKE++</a> and

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/srebughini/ASALI/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


# **ASALI: Modeling and beyond**
Asali is an open-source code developed for engineers, chemists and students working on the modeling of gas phase mixture.

The GUI version of Asali, thanks to its user-friendly interface, is very helpful for those approaching the modeling of gas phase mixture for the first time. Moreover, its deep interaction with [Cantera](https://cantera.org/) allows more expert users in performing detailed simulations without losing time in coding their own models.

Instead, the API version of Asali is designed for those approaching the modeling of gas phase mixture with the goal of becoming experts in the field. The API version can be easily integrated in different programming languages and it is the perfect starting point for everyone.

If you are looking for something more advanced and with higher performance, we suggest [OpenSMOKE++](https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/) and [Cantera](https://cantera.org/).
